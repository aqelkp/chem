			<p>Department of Chemical Engineering, IIT Madras is proud to present the 8th edition of its Annual Technical Festival ChemClave from March 13th - 15th, 2015.<br>
			We call it our annual celebration of the Spirit of Chemical Engineering rather than just some annual technical fest.<br> 
			Born in 2008, with the motto of promoting technology, scientific thinking and innovation in the field of Chemical Engineering, ChemClave has passed 7 golden editions and today it is successfully planning towards its 8th edition.<br>
			It provides an opportunity to all the budding Chemical Engineers to compete, exchange ideas, collaborate and learn and of course have fun all under the same roof.</p>
